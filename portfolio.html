                                        The purpose of this lab was to design a sequential circuit to program a Basys 3 board to
                                        play the game “Rainbow Road.” The objective of the
                                        game is to keep a car on the Rainbow Road. The road randomly generates at the top of the screen as the
                                        car drives up the road. The buttons btnL and btnR on the Basys board control the left and right steering
                                        of the car. As long as any portion of the car remains on the road, the game continues. The score
                                        increments as long as the car remains on the road as well. The game ends once the car fails to make
                                        contact with any of the road. The difficulty of the game can be increased by using switches 4-6 on 
                                        the Basys board to dictate the width of our road segments. This lab was programmed in Verilog.

                                        For my senior design project, my team and I chose to address the need to 
                                        reduce wildfire damage. The way we try to address this is with our IoT wildfire 
                                        alarm system. Our system used a 4G, WiFi, and GPS enabled microcontroller coupled with 
                                        different sensors to assess the fire risk of the device's surrounding area. 
                                        The data is sent to a server where the fire risk is assessed. There are three 
                                        levels of fire risk: low, moderate, and high. We relay this information to the 
                                        front-end of our system through a web-application with a map interface. We use 
                                        circles on the map to describe 
                                        the location of our device. The color of the circles on the map depict the fire risk. 
                                        Low fire risk is depicted with green, moderate fire risk is depicted with yellow, 
                                        and  high fire risk is depicted with red. The fire risk assessment is then displayed 
                                        on our fire risk web application that shows the fire risk of an area on a map.

                                        In this project we are given an x-y plane dynamical model of a small agile 
                                        quadrotor. A control loop is designed using this dynamical model. 
                                        Throughout the different parts of the lab we use the rltool 
                                        function on MATLAB to create a PID controller to stabilize the quadrotor.

                                        This lab is an introduction to quadrature encoders, time based sensors, and capacitive
                                        sensors. The quadrature encoder used in this lab is a rotary switch with an RGB LED. The
                                        objective for this device is to implement the quadrature encoder interface (QEI) to determine the
                                        position of the encoder and drive the color of the RGB LED as appropriate. The time based
                                        PING sensor will be used to measure the distance of the sensor to various objects. The PING
                                        sensor will have to be linearized using Least Squares. The capacitive touch sensor will be used
                                        to experiment with several techniques to measure change in capacitance. Every sensor will
                                        need modular non-blocking code developed for the sensor, enabling the user to interact with
                                        them and read them. This lab is done in C.

                                        A study and decomposition of the way penguins
                                        fly through water using their wings as propulsive mechanisms.
                                        Modeling of the locomotion is done in MATLAB. The wing is
                                        a penguin’s main proponent of thrust. Previous studies have
                                        researched the propulsive properties of penguin wings by fabricating hydrofoil models that are similar in shape to penguin
                                        wings, or fabricating 3D printed models of wings derived from
                                        scanned live penguin wings. This paper expands on their research
                                        by simulating the dynamic properties of swimming for different sized penguin wings, such as those of the Emperor and King
                                        penguins.
