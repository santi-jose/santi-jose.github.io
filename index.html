                                            Hello! Welcome to my website. 
                                            My name is Jose Luis Santiago, but my friends call me Santi,
                                            so you can call me that too! I am a class of 2021 UCSC alumni. 
                                            I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Engineering. My concentration
                                            is in Robotics and Control. 
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            As a child I spent a lot of time playing puzzle games on the computer. 
                                            The objective of these games were usually to escape a room or solve a 
                                            mystery by exploring every nook and cranny of the game's setting. It could 
                                            be a single room or a mansion. These kinds of games were the catalyst for 
                                            my love of programming. Programming to me is like a puzzle. The pieces of 
                                            the programming puzzle are the syntax and commands of the programming language,
                                                while the objective of the puzzle is to get the program to work. Like the 
                                            puzzle games I was enamored by, programming lets me scratch my problem-solving itch.
                                        </p>

                                            I have spent 3 years working as a peer adviser for the BSOE advising
                                            office at UCSC. I like helping people, even more so if I can get 
                                            paid to do it! As a BSOE peer adviser I work 1-on-1 with engineering 
                                            students to help them schedule their classes and navigate the academic
                                            landscape. I myself was admitted as an undeclared student so I felt lost
                                            for my freshman year as I took a wide array of classes to try and hone in
                                            on a field of study. I know how it feels to be lost trying to navigate 
                                            the higher education terrain, so this work is fulfilling to me. 
                                        </p>
